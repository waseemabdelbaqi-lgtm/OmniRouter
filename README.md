# OmniRouter

## Overview
OmniRouter is a project that aims to provide a unified API interface for all modern LLMs (Large Language Models). It enables seamless model switching and performance optimization, offering a convenient solution for developers and users alike.

## Contributing
When contributing to the project, please follow these guidelines:
- Do not make direct changes to the **dev** or **main** branches. Create a new branch for your feature development.
- Push your branch to the GitHub repository and submit a **pull request** to merge your changes into the **dev** branch.

## Building
To build the project, follow these steps:
1. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
2. Activate the virtual environment with `venv\Scripts\activate`.
3. Install all dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your provider keys. Download your Firebase service-account key to `firebase-credentials.json` (or point `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH` at it); `firebase-credentials.example.json` shows the expected format. Both `.env` and the credentials file are git-ignored; never commit real keys.
5. If you add new packages, update the package manager with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## Testing
To run the server and client components for testing:
- Run the server with `python -m testLib.server`.
- Run the chat client with `python -m testLib.chat_client`.
- Run the image client with `python -m testLib.image_client`.

## Codebase Structure
The codebase is organized into the following main sections:
- `clientLib`: Contains client-side libraries and utilities.
- `testLib`: Contains the testing framework to run when validating new builds
- `serverRouter`: Includes the core functionality of the OmniRouter server.
  - `core`: Defines data models and core functionalities.
    - `datamodels`: Contains the response and request objects to be sent from the client
    - `interfaces`: Contains a chat and image interface for providers to extend and implement.
    - `models`: Contains the list of image and chat models along with their information.
    - `exceptions`: Contains exceptions for the API
  - `providers`: Contains provider implementations for different LLM models.
  - `router.py`: Main FastAPI router for handling API requests. Entry point to the application
- `docs`: API documentation and guides
  - `reasoning_api.md`: Documentation for using the reasoning API
  - `claude_code.md`: Using OmniRouter as the API endpoint for Claude Code

## Core Features
The project offers the following core features in its implementation order:
1. Unified API Interface: Standardized API for all models.
2. Basic Documentation: User-friendly guides and references.
3. Dynamic Routing: Route queries to the best or most cost-efficient model.
4. Customizable Routing Rules: User-defined criteria for model selection.
5. Chat Interface: GPT-like interface for model selection during queries.
6. Reasoning API: Enhanced reasoning capabilities for step-by-step problem solving.

## API Documentation

### Anthropic Messages API (Claude Code)
`POST /v1/messages` and `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` pass requests through to Anthropic, so Claude Code and other Anthropic SDK clients can use OmniRouter as their `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. See [Using OmniRouter with Claude Code](docs/claude_code.md).

### Chat API
Standard chat completions interface compatible with OpenAI's API.

### Image API
Image generation interface compatible with OpenAI's API.

### Reasoning API
Advanced reasoning capabilities for complex problem solving. Models with extended thinking capabilities provide step-by-step reasoning alongside their responses. See [Reasoning API Documentation](docs/reasoning_api.md) for details on:

- Available reasoning models
- How to use the reasoning API
- Streaming reasoning responses
- Understanding reasoning effort levels
- Controlling reasoning budget
